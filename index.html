		<div id="text1"><h2>RETAIL SPACES</h2><h3>Spaces in Tribeca have their own identity: they are historic, landmark buildings with high ceilings, old facades and provide owners a lot of raw material that can be restored into something beautiful. This creates a fascinating sense of new and old blending together.</h3></div>
